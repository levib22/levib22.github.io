    <p>This is an example paragraph. Anything in the <strong>body</strong> tag will appear on the page, just like this <strong>p</strong> tag and its contents. I guess let me see how much I can write in one line before it adds a newline character or if it ever does or if it lets the next run off of the page</p>
    <p> I'm trying to put a <a href="https://github.com/levib22/SampleProjects">link to a personal site</a></p>
